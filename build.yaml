# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix.
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them to the top level board and
# shield arrays, for more control, add individual board + shield combinations
# to the `include` property. You can also use the `cmake-args` property to
# pass flags to the build command and `artifact-name` to assign a name to
# distinguish build outputs from each other:
#
# board: [ "seeeduino_xiao_ble" ]
# shield: [ "36_xiao_ble_left", "36_xiao_ble_right" ]
#     cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_USB_LOGGING=y
#     artifact-name: 36_xiao_ble_left_logging
